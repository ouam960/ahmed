Cardholders can also use the app to manage account alert settings, check their FICO score, dispute a transaction, manage travel plans, replace their card and contact customer service. If you hold other accounts with Wells Fargo — including checking, savings, mortgage, student loan or personal loan accounts — they’ll also be visible on the app when you log in. For Android phones, the app offers the Wells Fargo Wallet feature, a digital wallet that allows you to add your Wells Fargo debit and credit cards. You can use your Wells Fargo Wallet at NFC-enabled point-of-sale systems to pay with your phone instead of the physical card."
